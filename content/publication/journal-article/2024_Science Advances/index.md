abstract: Animals evolve diverse pigment patterns to adapt to the natural environment. Countershading, characterized by a dark-colored dorsum and a light-colored ventrum, is one of the most prevalent pigment patterns observed in vertebrates. In this study, we reveal a mechanism regulating xanthophore countershading in zebrafish embryos. We found that <i>csf1a</i> and <i>csf1b</i> mutants altered xanthophore countershading differently, <i>csf1a</i> mutants lack ventral xanthophores, while <i>csf1b</i> mutants have reduced dorsal xanthophores. Further study revealed that <i>csf1a</i> is  expressed  throughout  the  trunk,  whereas  <i>csf1b</i>  is  expressed  dorsally.  Ectopic  expression  of  <i>csf1a</i>  or  <i>csf1b</i>  in  neurons attracted xanthophores into the spinal cord. Blocking <i>csf1</i> signaling by <i>csf1ra</i> mutants disrupts spinal cord distribution and normal xanthophores countershading. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified two <i>col1a2<sup>+</sup></i> populations,<i>csf1a<sup>high</sup>csf1b<sup>high</sup></i> muscle progenitors and <i>csf1a<sup>high</sup>csf1b<sup>low</sup></i> fibroblast progenitors. Ablation of <i>col1a2<sup>+</sup></i> fibroblast and muscle progenitors abolished xanthophore patterns. Our study suggests that fibroblast and muscle progenitors differentially express <i>csf1a</i> and <i>csf1b</i> to modulate xanthophore patterning, providing insights into the mechanism of countershading.
