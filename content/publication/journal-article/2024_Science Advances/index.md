abstract: Animals evolve diverse pigment patterns to adapt to the natural environment. Countershading, characterized by a dark-colored dorsum and a light-colored ventrum, is one of the most prevalent pigment patterns observed in vertebrates. In this study, we reveal a mechanism regulating xanthophore countershading in zebrafish embryos. We found that csf1a and csf1b mutants altered xanthophore countershading differently: csf1a mutants lack ventral xanthophores, while csf1b mutants have reduced dorsal xanthophores. Further study revealed that csf1a is expressed throughout the trunk, whereas csf1b is expressed dorsally. Ectopic expression of csf1a or csf1b in neurons attracted xanthophores into the spinal cord. Blocking csf1 signaling by csf1ra mutants disrupts spinal cord distribution and normal xanthophores countershading. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified two col1a2+ populations: csf1ahighcsf1bhigh muscle progenitors and csf1ahighcsf1blow fibroblast progenitors. Ablation of col1a2+ fibroblast and muscle progenitors abolished xanthophore patterns. Our study suggests that fibroblast and muscle progenitors differentially express csf1a and csf1b to modulate xanthophore patterning, providing insights into the mechanism of countershading.
