abstract: Signaling proteins often form biomolecular condensates through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) during intracellular signal transduction. Modulating the LLPS property of intracellular protein condensates will redirect intracellular signals and provide a potential way to regulate cellular physiology. Phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues of the transmembrane receptor nephrin is known to drive the LLPS of the adaptor protein Nck and neuronal Wiskott–Aldrich Syndrome protein (N-WASP) and form the Nck signaling complex. Phosphorylation of the translocated intimin receptor (Tir) in the host cell may recruit this enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) virulence factor to the Nck signaling complex and lead to the entry of EPEC into the intestine cell. In this work, we first identified a phosphotyrosine (pY)-containing peptide 3pY based on the sequence similarity of nephrin and Tir; 3pY promoted the LLPS of Nck and N-WASP, mimicking the role of phosphorylated nephrin. Next, we designed a covalent blocker of Nck, peptide p1 based on the selected pY peptides, which site-selectively reacted with the SH2 domain of Nck (Nck-SH2) at Lys331 through a proximity-induced reaction. The covalent reaction of p1 with Nck blocked the protein binding site of Nck-SH2 and disintegrated the 3pY/Nck/N-WASP condensates. In the presence of membrane-translocating peptide L17E, p1 entered Caco-2 cells in the cytosol, reduced the number of Nck puncta, and rendered Caco-2 cells resistant to EPEC infection. Site-selective covalent blockage of Nck thereby disintegrates intracellular Nck condensates, inhibits actin reorganization, and shuts down the entrance pathway of EPEC. This work showcases the promotion or inhibition of protein phase separation by synthetic peptides and the use of reactive peptides as LLPS disruptors and signal modulators.
