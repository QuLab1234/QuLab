### **1. In vivo imaging study of spinal cord injury**

<font face=Times New Roman>
In vivo spinal cord imaging in mouse models without introducing immunological artifacts is critical to understand spinal cord pathology and discover effective treatments. 
We developed a minimally invasive intervertebral window by retaining the ligamentum flavum to protect the underlying spinal cord. By introducing an optical clearing method, 
we study neuron-glia dynamics following laser axotomy and observe strengthened contact of microglia with the nodes of Ranvier during axonal degeneration.
By enabling long-term, repetitive, stable, high-resolution and inflammation-free imaging of mouse spinal cord, our method provides a reliable platform in the research aiming 
at interpretation of spinal cord physiology and pathology.

### **2. In vivo metabolic imaging and monitoring of adipose tissue**

<img align="right" src="/imagess/B/2fat.jpg" alt="Pulpit rock" width="470" height="400" />

<br/>

We investigated the metabolic characteristics of adipose tissues in live mouse model using a multiphoton redox ratio,
fluorescence lifetime imaging technology and stimulated Raman scattering microscopy. Our study uncovered significant 
heterogeneity in the cellular structures and metabolic characteristics of thermogenic adipocytes in brown and beige fat.
Subgroups of brown and beige adipocytes were identified based on the distinct lipid size distributions, redox ratios, 
fluorescence lifetimes and thermogenic capacities. The results of our study show that this label-free imaging technique 
can shed new light on in vivo study of metabolic dynamics and heterogeneity of adipose tissues in live organisms.

### **3. Quantitative Imaging of Biological Dynamics by Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy**

<img align="right" src="/imagess/B/3Mitochondria.jpg" alt="Pulpit rock" width="470" height="400" />
<br/>
Quantitative methods to precisely measure cellular states in vivo have become increasingly important and desirable in modern biology.
We developed a technique based on SRS microscopy of vibrational tags for quantitative imaging of lipid synthesis, lipolysis and
biodistributions in live animals and cells. The technique aims to overcome the major limitations of conventional fluorescent 
and lipid extraction methods that do not provide the capability of in vivo quantitative analysis. Using a hyperspectral SRS (hsSRS)
microscope and subtraction method, we demonstrated the unique capability of hsSRS microscopy in quantitative analysis of lipid metabolism 
in vivo. We reported a probe, named AIE-SRS-Mito, for imaging mitochondria in live cells via fluorescence (FL) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging.
