Our congratulations go to Dong Li, a 2011 PhD graduate from our lab, for being selected in the 2022 New Cornerstone Investigator Program (新基石研究员项目). This program, created by Tencent as a nonprofit and independent fund, seeks to encourage basic research that has profound significance for humanity by providing long-term and stable support to a selected group of exceptional scientists. Among the 58 scientists chosen for the program is Professor Li, who will receive an annual budget of up to 5 million RMB (for experimental research) over a five-year period.
